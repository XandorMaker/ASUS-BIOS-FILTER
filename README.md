#ASUS BIOS Filter

ASUS BIOS Filter is a simple program designed to organize ASUS BIOS files. The program needs to be placed in the same folder where the BIOS files are located.

Upon running the executable, the program filters the BIOS files and keeps only the latest version. Any older versions are moved to a subfolder named "OLD_BIOS_FILES".
After the program has finished updating the BIOS files, it clears the console and displays a message indicating that the program has completed its task. The user is prompted to hit Enter to close the window.
